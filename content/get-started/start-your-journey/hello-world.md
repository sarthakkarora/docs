# My Coding Journey Starts Here “Hello World!”

Welcome to your coding adventure! In this tutorial, we'll dive into the basics of coding “Hello World” and collaboration using GitHub's pull request workflow. Whether you're a prac developer or just starting out, this guide will walk you through the essentials of repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests, setting you on the path to becoming a coding pro.

## Introduction

In this quickstart guide, you will:

- Create and use a repository.
- Start and manage a new branch.
- Make changes to a file and push them to {% data variables.product.product_name %} as commits.
- Open and merge a pull request.

### Prerequisites

- You must have a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account. {% ifversion fpt or ghec %}For more information, see "[Creating an account on GitHub](/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github)".{% endif %}
- You don't need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software that {% data variables.product.product_name %} is built on).

## Step 1: Let's Build our Project starting off with creating our first repo

To kick things off, we're going to create a project repository. Think of it as your digital workspace where you'll bring your coding ideas to life. But don't worry, you won't be alone in this journey – GitHub makes collaboration a breeze!

Follow these simple steps to create your project repository:

1. **Create a new repository**:
   - Name your repository something catchy and meaningful. How about "My Coding Adventure"?
   - Add a short description to tell others what your project is all about.
   - Choose whether your repository should be public or private.
   - Add a README file to get started.

## Step 2: Let Your Ideas Branch Out by creating a branch

Branching out is where the real fun begins! It's like exploring different paths on your coding journey. With branches, you can experiment, make changes, and test new ideas without affecting your main project.

### Creating a branch

1. **Create a new branch**:
   - Click the **Code** tab of your repository.
   - Above the file list, click the dropdown menu that says **main**.
   - Type a branch name, `readme-edits`, into the text box.
   - Click **Create branch: readme-edits from main**.

## Step 3: Making and committing changes

Now that you've set up your project and branched out, it's time to get coding! Let your creativity flow as you make changes to your project files. Every change you make will be saved as a commit, documenting your progress along the way.

Here's how to make and save your changes:

1. **Make and commit changes**:
   - Click on a file in your repository to open it.
   - Make your edits right in the GitHub interface.
   - Write a brief description of your changes in the commit message box.
   - Hit **Commit changes** to save your work.

## Step 4: Open a pull request

Coding is more fun when you do it together! With pull requests, you can share your work with others, gather feedback, and collaborate on making your project even better.

Let's open a pull request to share your changes:

1. **Open a pull request**:
   - Go to the **Pull requests** tab of your repository.
   - Click **New pull request**.
   - Choose the branch you created earlier as the "compare" branch.
   - Review your changes and click **Create pull request**.
   - Give your pull request a title and description, then hit **Create pull request** again.

## Step 5: Time to Merge

Once your pull request is open, you can collaborate with others, discuss your changes, and refine your project together. When you're ready, it's time to merge your changes into the main project!

1. **Merge your pull request**:
   - Click **Merge pull request**.
   - Confirm the merge and celebrate your first collaboration success!
   - Don't forget to **Delete branch** to keep your project organized.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've taken your first steps into the exciting world of coding and collaboration using GitHub's pull request workflow. With these fundamental skills under your belt, you're ready to tackle even bigger coding adventures ahead.
